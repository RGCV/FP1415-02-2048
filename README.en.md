### 2nd FP Project - 14'15

### Problem Description

2048 is a mathematical brain teaser in which the player slides panels numbered
in a 4 x 4 square grid. The game was created in March 2014 by Gabriele Cirulli,
an italian web programmer, and is available for free on the web and as an app
for various mobile platforms.

The goal of the game is to combine panels with the same number in order to
create a panel with the number 2048. In order to do that, the player can "drag"
the panels in each of four directions - up, down, left and right. When an action
is applied to the board, this affects *all* the panels with room to move.

After each move, a new panel appears in a free position of the board, chosen
randomly. This new panel has the number 2 or the number 4.

With this project, it is intended that a program is written in `Python` that
defines a set of data types that should be used to manipulate the necessary
information during the game, as well as a set of aditional helper functions that
will allow the user to play the game itself.
